# Library of voice-triggered code snippets for Python 3 using Voice-In Plus

These snippets are for the common elements of Python scripts.
Their templates are meant to help prompt one's memory of the proper structure of the various elements in a Python program.

Only snippets for  Python 3 are supplied.
These snippets can be used when working with Python code in a text area of a web browser such as in a Jupyter or Colab notebook or in a  Python script file that is being edited inside of Jupyter Lab.

## Usage

- Open the *python.csv* file in a text editor or in the raw view on GitHub.
- Select all, copy, and paste into the text area exposed upon clicking on the **bulk add** window in Voice-In Plus.
- Hit the **Add Commands** button to add the new commands.
- Activate Voice In Plus in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
- Speak the voice command (in the left column of the CSV file) with the cursor in a code cell in a Jupyter Notebook or in a Python script file that has been opened for editing inside Jupyter Lab.
